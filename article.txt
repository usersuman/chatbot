Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known
to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
COVID-19  is  the  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  most  recently
discovered corona virus. This  new virus  and disease were unknown
before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
dry   cough.   Some   patients   may   have   aches   and   pains,   nasal
congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
don’t  develop  any  symptoms  and  don't  feel  unwell.  Most  people
(about   80%)   recover   from   the   disease   without   needing   special
treatment.  Around  1  out  of  every  6  people  who  gets  COVID-19
becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
attention.
People  can  catch  COVID-19  from  others  who  have  the  virus.  The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs  or  exhales.  These  droplets  land  on  objects  and  surfaces
around  the  person.  Other  people  then  catch  COVID-19  by  touching
these  objects  or  surfaces,  then  touching  their  eyes,  nose  or  mouth.
People  can  also  catch  COVID-19  if  they  breathe  in  droplets  from  a
person  with  COVID-19  who  coughs  out  or  exhales  droplets.  This  is
why  it  is  important  to  stay  more  than  1  meter  (3  feet)  away  from  a
person who is sick.
Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
transmitted   through   contact   with   respiratory   droplets   rather   than
through  the  air.   See  previous  answer  on  “How  does  COVID-19
spread?”
The  main  way  the  disease  spreads  is  through  respiratory  droplets
expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
from  someone  with  no  symptoms  at  all  is  very  low.  However,  many
people   with   COVID-19   experience   only   mild   symptoms.   This   is
particularly  true  at  the  early  stages  of  the  disease.  It  is  therefore
possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
a mild cough and does not feel ill.
The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
main  feature  of  the  outbreak.  The  ongoing  research  on  the  ways
COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
after using the bathroom and before eating.
Protection measures for everyone
Stay  aware  of  the  latest  information  on  the  COVID-19  outbreak,
available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-
19 by taking some simple precautions:
•      Regularly  and  thoroughly  clean  your  hands  with  an  alcohol-
based   hand   rub   or   wash   them   with   soap   and   water.
Why?  Washing  your  hands   with   soap  and   water   or   using
alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
•      Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
anyone          who          is          coughing          or          sneezing.
Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
are  too  close,  you  can  breathe  in  the  droplets,  including  the
COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
•      Avoid         touching         eyes,          nose         and          
mouth.
Why?  Hands  touch  many  surfaces  and  can  pick  up  viruses.
Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your  body and
can make you sick.
•      Make   sure   you,   and   the   people   around   you,   follow   good
respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
dispose         of         the         used         tissue         immediately.
•      Stay  home  if  you  feel  unwell.  If  you  have  a  fever,  cough  and
difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
Follow    the    directions    of    your    local    health    authority.
Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
of viruses and other infections.
•      Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
areas  where  COVID-19  is  spreading  widely).  If  possible,  avoid
traveling  to  places   –  especially  if  you  are  an  older  person  or
have          diabetes,          heart          or          lung          
disease.

Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading
o  Follow  the  guidance  outlined  above  (Protection  measures  for
everyone)
o  Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
or  above)  and  slight  runny  nose,  until  you  recover.  If  it  is
essential for you to have someone bring you supplies  or to go
out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other
people.
o  If   you   develop   fever,   cough   and   difficulty   breathing,   seek
medical  advice  promptly  as  this  may  be  due  to  a  respiratory
infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your
provider   of   any   recent   travel   or   contact   with   travelers.
Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to
quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to
prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.
The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether
there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For  most  people  in  most  locations  the  risk  of  catching  COVID-19  is
still  low.  However,  there  are  now  places  around  the  world  (cities  or
areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
these  areas  the  risk  of  catching  COVID-19  is  higher.  Governments
and  health  authorities  are  taking  vigorous  action  every  time  a  new
case  of  COVID-19  is  identified.  Be  sure  to  comply  with  any  local
restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
disease control efforts  will reduce your  risk  of catching or spreading
COVID-19.
COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
has  been  shown  in  China  and  some  other  countries.  Unfortunately,
new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
situation where you are or intend to go.
Illness  due  to  COVID-19  infection  is  generally  mild,  especially  for
children  and  young  adults.  However,  it  can  cause  serious  illness:
about  1  in  every  5  people  who  catch  it  need  hospital  care.  It  is
therefore quite normal for  people to worry about  how the COVID-19
outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We  can  channel  our  concerns  into  actions  to  protect  ourselves,  our
loved  ones  and  our  communities.  First  and  foremost  among  these
actions  is  regular  and  thorough  hand-washing  and  good  respiratory
hygiene.  Secondly,  keep informed and follow the advice of the local
health  authorities  including  any  restrictions  put  in  place  on  travel,
movement and gatherings.
While  we  are  still  learning  about  how  COVID-2019  affects  people,
older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
as  high  blood  pressure,  heart  disease,  lung  disease,  cancer  or
diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?
No.  Antibiotics   do  not  work   against  viruses,  they  only  work  on
bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
treatment  of  COVID-19.  They  should  only  be  used  as  directed  by a
physician to treat a bacterial infection.
While  some  western,  traditional  or  home  remedies  may  provide
comfort  and  alleviate  symptoms  of  COVID-19,  there  is  no  evidence
that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
as  a  prevention  or  cure  for  COVID-19.  However,  there  are  several
ongoing   clinical   trials   that   include   both   western   and   
traditional
medicines. We will  continue  to  provide  updated  information  as  soon
as clinical findings are available.
Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
to  prevent  or  treat  COVID-2019.  However,  those  affected  should
receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible  vaccines  and  some  specific  drug  treatments  are  under
investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.
The  most   effective  ways   to  protect   yourself   and  others   against
COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
the  bend  of  elbow  or  tissue,  and  maintain  a  distance  of  at  least  1
meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing
No.  The  virus  that  causes  COVID-19  and  the  one  that  caused  the
outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
related  to  each  other  genetically,  but  the  diseases  they  cause  are
quite different.
SARS  was  more  deadly  but  much  less  infectious  than  COVID-19.
There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since
2003.
Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
coughing)   or   looking   after   someone   who   may   have   COVID-19.
Disposable  face  mask  can  only  be  used  once.  If  you  are  not  ill  or
looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
a  world-wide  shortage  of  masks,  so  We  urge  people  to  use  masks
wisely.
We  advises  rational  use  of  medical  masks  to  avoid  unnecessary
wastage  of  precious  resources  and  mis-use  of  masks   The  most
effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
or  tissue  and  maintain  a  distance  of  at  least  1  meter  (3  feet)  from
people who are coughing or sneezing.
1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
2. Before  touching  the  mask,  clean  hands  with  an  alcohol-based
hand rub or soap and water
3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
5. Ensure   the   proper   side   of   the   mask   faces   outwards   (the
coloured side).
6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
chin.
8. After  use,  take  off  the  mask;  remove  the  elastic  loops  from
behind  the  ears  while  keeping  the  mask  away  from  your  face
and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
of the mask.
9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
10.        Perform  hand  hygiene  after  touching  or  discarding  the
mask  –  Use  alcohol-based  hand  rub  or,  if  visibly  soiled,  wash
your hands with soap and water.
The  “incubation  period”  means  the  time  between  catching  the  virus
and  beginning  to  have  symptoms  of  the  disease.  Most  estimates  of
the  incubation  period  for  COVID-19  range  from  1-14  days,  most
commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more
data become available.
Coronaviruses  are  a  large  family  of  viruses  that  are  common  in
animals.  Occasionally,  people  get  infected  with  these  viruses  which
may  then  spread  to  other  people.  For  example,  SARS-CoV  was
associated   with   civet   cats   and   MERS-CoV   is   transmitted   by
dromedary  camels.  Possible  animal  sources  of  COVID-19  have  not
yet been confirmed.
To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
direct  contact  with  animals  and  surfaces  in  contact  with  animals.
Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk
or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods
and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.
While  there  has  been one  instance  of  a  dog  being  infected  in  Hong
Kong,  to date,  there  is  no  evidence  that  a  dog,  cat  or  any  pet  can
transmit  COVID-19.  COVID-19  is  mainly  spread  through  droplets
produced  when  an  infected  person  coughs,  sneezes,  or  speaks.  To
protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-
19 topics and will update as new findings are available.
It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
surfaces,  but  it  seems  to  behave  like  other  corona  viruses.  Studies
suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
COVID-19  virus)  may  persist  on  surfaces  for  a  few  hours  or  up  to
several  days.  This  may  vary  under  different  conditions  (e.g.  type  of
surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with
an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
Yes.  The  likelihood  of  an  infected  person  contaminating commercial
goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19
from  a  package  that  has  been  moved,  travelled,  and  exposed  to
different conditions and temperature is also low.
The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and
can be harmful:
•      Smoking
•      Wearing multiple masks
•      Taking antibiotics (See question 10 "Are there any medicines of
therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?")
In  any  case,  if  you  have  fever,  cough  and  difficulty  breathing
seek  medical  care  early to  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  a  more
severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with
your health care provider.
